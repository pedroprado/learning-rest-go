Black Box Tests
(State Verification)

-Black box tests only care about "inputs" and "outputs"
-They validate the OUTPUTS for a given INPUT
-They dont care about the inner behavior of the module being tested


White Box Tests
(Behavior verification)

-Tests that know about the inner behavior of the module
-They are focused in validadte THE BEHAVIOR of that module


Functional Testing
-Uses Black Box concept: they validate the output of a given testing module
-Functional Tests need a Running Aplication to be performed
-These tests should validate the output, and the last layer used should be mocked 
(for example, mocking the response of a external api provider)
