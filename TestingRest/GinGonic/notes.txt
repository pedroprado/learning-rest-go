Why is so  Hard to Mock in Go?

-Go is a compiled laguage: thus, we cannot change the behaviour of a function at RUNTIME
-In the background, when go is testing it is compiling the code and executing the test cases
against that compiled code 
-Thus, we cannot mock functions (because it is already compiled)!
-What we can do is CHANGE the behaviour of functions, according to the context (main context, test context)
-This behavior is changed by using INTERFACES 
-Mocks can be done through an Interface: The layers should be interfaces


FUNCTIONS cannot be mocked, but METHODS CAN BE MOCKED!

-METHODS are FUNCTIONS  that are TIED to a Go Type!
-We can create METHODS by IMPLEMENTING INTERFACES in certain types
